#MINI-AVC INFO

Alright, this is pretty important. So go ahead and have a sit down. Let's talk about it.

The KSP community add-on guidelines state that we can't contact another network or computer system without clearly stating what it does, so here we go.
Mini-AVC is a plugin that the KSP addon version checker addon uses. We have put this in our mod so you, the player, can keep up with the versions. When you boot up the game
there will be a windows asking if you would like to opt-in to addon version checking. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent.
